### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Steaks:**

2. **Sear the Steaks:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
   - Add the steaks to the hot skillet. Sear for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until a crust forms and they are cooked to your desired doneness (130Â°F for medium-rare).

3. **Rest the Steaks:**
   - Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest on a plate.

4. **Make the Caramelized Garlic Sauce:**
   - Reduce the heat to medium. Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
   - Add the brown sugar, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar to the skillet. Stir to combine and let the mixture simmer for 2-3 minutes until it thickens slightly.

5. **Coat the Steaks:**
   - Return the steaks to the skillet, turning them to coat in the caramelized garlic sauce. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, spooning the sauce over the steaks.
